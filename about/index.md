Currently, I'm working on agentic foundation model research at [Fig.ai](https://fig.inc/) & [Manifold Research Group](https://www.manifoldrg.com/) with a focus on general-purpose software controlling systems. My work explores the methods and techniques to make today's agentic models more generalizable and reliable, drawing inspiration from fields like Multi Modal Representation Learning, Theory of Mind, Complex Dynamical Systems, Control Theory, and Deep Reinforcement Learning to create agents that can learn, reason, and generalize effectively.
