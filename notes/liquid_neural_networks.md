### Challenges in DL Today
1. Models don't generalize well to unseen test scenarios
  - Learning theory fundamentally designed for i.i.d data
  - Robustness to distribution shifts
  - Explainability is limited due to model size, complexity and inductive biases

2. Model trained offline do not perform well online
  - Compounding error
  - Lack of robustness to distribution shifts
  - Lack of causal representation learning


Limitations:
- Long training and test time for larger networks


Solutions:
1. use stable
2.
